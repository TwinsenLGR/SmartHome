    + REMOTE CONTROL V1.1.
        - Change the encapsulation of the microcontroller from QFN28 to MLF32... I got confused and it is cheaper to make the boards again than to buy the correct microcontrollers.
        - Make the PCB with 1mm thickness.
        - Change the button component from 6x6 to 5x5mm
        - Adjust the size of the PCB so that it is as close as possible to the housing.
